# EasyXCStats


EasyXCStats is an application that adds a public users most recent Strava run to XCStats

## Installation

Click main.exe and then download. You can also download credentials.txt as a template for inputting your credentials. The python files are not necessary but are there for open source purposes.


## Usage

Put main.exe and credentials.txt in the same folder.

Inside credentials.txt you should format the information like this.
```
XCStats account email
XCStats account password
Strava user id
```
Example:
```
XCStatsEmail@email.com
Password123
12345678
```
If you don't know what your Strava user id is you can follow these steps

1. Go to your own profile on a computer web browser
2. Look at the url and copy the number that is after https://www.strava.com/athletes/

So if the url is https://www.strava.com/athletes/12345678, then your user id is 12345678.

**Note that if your Strava account if private, this program will not work.** If anyone wants me to make EasyXCStats compatible with private accounts then dm me (read Contributing below).

## Contributing

You can add me on discord tatertot#2643 and dm for suggestions.

I may make this program work with private accounts, and run in the background to eliminate the manual aspect of it, but I need at least one person to dm me for me to work on it as if nobody needs it then I won't do it.
